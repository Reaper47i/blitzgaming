# BlitzGaming

A gaming startup mock website that organises and takes part in Esports events.

@Timeline

while building this project some things that I need to implement:=
1> not everything will be client rendered
2> some parts that are static will be made in plain html
3> parts that involve user input or dynamic activity will be done by
writing templates ad rendering them in html from js.
4> a minimal design for the time being
